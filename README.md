# Overview

I have chosen to undertake this project as my first end-to-end project, aiming to leverage my extensive experience in credit risk analysis. The main goal of the dashboard is to help analyze and identify different factors that influence loan default rates. The project covers the entire processâ€”from data exploration and cleaning to manipulation and preparationâ€”using tools such as Excel, SQL, and Power BI. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes customer profiles, as well as historical and current loan statuses, along with loan details such as amounts, terms, and interest rates.
